abstract: Instructor Talk—the noncontent language used by an instructor during
  class time—is likely to influence learning environments in science classrooms
  from the student perspective. Despite Instructor Talk being found in every
  science course thus far, investigations into student perceptions and memories
  of it are limited. We investigated to what extent undergraduate biology
  students 1) were aligned with researchers in their perceptions of Instructor
  Talk as Positively Phrased or Negatively Phrased and 2) remembered Instructor
  Talk. To test these ideas, we engaged 90 biology students in a multipart
  assessment. First, students were given randomly selected Instructor Talk
  quotes, half Positively Phrased and half Negatively Phrased, and were asked to
  evaluate each quote as promoting a positive or negative learning environment.
  Overall, students evaluated the Instructor Talk quotes similarly to
  researchers’ categorizations (p < 0.0001). Second, students were asked to
  provide examples of remembered instructor language from their biology courses
  that they felt promoted a positive or negative learning environment. Most
  students shared multiple memories, and ∼75% of these memories could be coded
  with the Instructor Talk frameworks. Given that students perceive and remember
  Instructor Talk as impacting the learning environment, Instructor Talk may be
  an explanatory variable for differential student outcomes across studies of
  active learning.
