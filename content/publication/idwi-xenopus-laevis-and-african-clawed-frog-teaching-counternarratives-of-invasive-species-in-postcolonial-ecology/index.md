abstract: "This article presents a Pedagogical Framework for Invasive Species to
  shift how we understand, teach, and study invasive species, especially when
  people are responsible for their expansion into new ecosystems. The focus is
  on a species originating from countries in Sub-Saharan Africa that humans
  extracted and introduced in certain regions of the Americas, Europe, and Asia:
  Xenopus laevis, African Clawed Frog, or Idwi in the Zulu language. This
  article re-introduces the frog Idwi through lenses of de/post-colonial theory,
  Indigenous studies, and Critical Race Theory to create counternarratives.
  Through a popular press analysis, the article uncovers how humans in colonial
  contexts extracted species from de/colonizing spaces to export to other
  regions of the world. When the frogs were profitable, the entrepreneurs who
  exported them were valorized. However, once seen as invasive, frogs were
  targeted with xenophobic projections. This article foregrounds
  counternarratives that challenge and critique universal application of the
  “invasive species” label."
