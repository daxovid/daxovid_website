abstract: Instructor Talk—noncontent and nonlogistical language that is focused
  on shaping the classroom learning environment—is a recently defined variable
  that may play an important role in how undergraduates experience courses.
  Previous research characterized Instructor Talk used by faculty teaching in
  biology lecture classrooms. However, graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) and
  laboratory classrooms represent critical factors in undergraduate education,
  and Instructor Talk in this context has yet to be explored. Here, we present
  findings analyzing Instructor Talk used by GTAs teaching in undergraduate
  biology laboratory classrooms. We characterized the Instructor Talk used by 22
  GTA instructors across 24 undergraduate biology laboratory courses in the
  context of a single, urban, Hispanic-serving and Asian American and Pacific
  Islander–serving Institution. We found that Instructor Talk was present in
  every course studied, GTAs with pedagogical training and prior teaching
  experience used more Instructor Talk than those without, and GTAs teaching
  laboratory courses used more Instructor Talk than previous observations of
  faculty teaching lecture courses. Given the widespread use of Instructor Talk
  and its varying use across contexts, we predict that Instructor Talk may be a
  critical variable in teaching, specifically in promoting equity and inclusion,
  which merits continued study in undergraduate science education.
