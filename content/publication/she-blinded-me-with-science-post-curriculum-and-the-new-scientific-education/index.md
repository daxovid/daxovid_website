abstract: Curriculum scholarship provides the engagement with curriculum
  differentiation that has defined the field since its inception. Mainly,
  curriculum scholars shift from the role of science as arbiter of truth to the
  politics of truth, as science becomes a target of ideology critique.
  “Post-curriculum” is a place of radical questioning about the guarantees of a
  traditional science of curriculum. We explore a “new scientific education” not
  as a rejection of scientific thought and method as much as an assertion of the
  centrality of skepticism to the scientific endeavor itself. New science
  recalls the anti-traditionalism of science in the Enlightenment, and
  post-curriculum is a place of ambivalence that marks a new intellectual place
  from which to theorize curriculum scholarship’s relationship with science.
