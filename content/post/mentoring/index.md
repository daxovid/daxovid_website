This is a short blurb on a complex topic that I care about a lot – mentoring. I've benefitted so much from mentoring in my life, and I'm committed to paying it forward.

It's kind of surprising that we don't require statements of mentoring philosophies in faculty job applications, given what an integral component this is to how faculty impact students' lives – for better or for worst. So, it's on us to be self-motivated and learn more about these topics.

A great resource for mentors and mentees is the National Academies podcast on [The Science of Effective Mentoring in STEMM](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/the-science-of-effective-mentoring-in-stemm). I think it's important for us to take initiative in engaging with these resources and the research behind mentoring – not only to be the best mentors we can be but to **become** the best mentors we need to become for students from backgrounds excluded from the sciences.

Below, I cover some introductions to aspects of mentorship, how to build mentoring networks, and my ever-evolving approach to mentoring.

## What are aspects of mentorship?

Finding a mentor is no easy task. One thing to consider is what kind of support is needed from mentoring. [Dr. Mica Estrada et al. (2018)](https://www.lifescied.org/doi/full/10.1187/cbe.17-04-0066) summarize different facets of mentoring as follows:

"First, mentors can provide **instrumental support**, providing resources and opportunity to the protégé to engage in goal attainment (Kram, 1985), which can include “the specific mentor behaviors of providing task-related assistance, sponsorship, exposure and visibility, and coaching” (Eby et al., 2013, p. 3). Second, **psychosocial support** occurs when a mentor enhances “an individual’s sense of competence, identity, and effectiveness in a professional role” (Kram, 1985, p. 32). This may also include facilitating emotional and personal development (Flaxman et al., 1988; Nakkula and Harris, 2013). A third, relationship quality (sometimes referred to as “relationship satisfaction”) is an **affective assessment of liking**, which may include feelings of trust, empathy, respect, and connectedness (Ragins, 2010). Most of the empirical research showing mentorship is important to positive outcomes emerges from studies of youth mentorship and the business world (meta-analyses by Allen et al., 2004), with the outcome of these studies typically being academic and **career advancement**. However, Eby et al.’s (2013) meta-analysis of mentorship research shows that there is robust evidence for instrumental and psychosocial support contributing to relationship quality in a self-enforcing cycle. **And the combination of these mentorship qualities is positively related to performance, motivation, career outcomes, and health for protégés.**" (bold added for emphasis)

It's assumed that one's advisor is de facto one's mentor. Indeed, working in someone's lab or interning with someone means you're getting professional experience with that person and will likely ask them for a reference at some point. But there are plenty of people with whom you might not work directly that can also be sources of support and networking opportunities.

## Building mentoring networks

Some people have connections within their friend and family circles that are in alignment with long-term professional skill building and career interests; however, many people – including first-generation college going students, students from working-class backgrounds, and/or international students – may not have those connections at the start of their college career. 

So how do we build a mentoring network to support our long-term professional pursuits if we don't have one to start?

Reaching out through professional networks (LinkedIn or Email) and introducing yourself and asking if the person would be willing to connect for 15min to discuss your career interests is not an uncommon way to start. It makes a good impression to learn what you can about the person in advance from online bios and resources. Informational interviews to learn more about what a job entails day-day and what skills you might need to develop to prepare for such a position are a great way to make an introduction. And who know - there might be a job opening down the road! Lastly, it might be useful to ask if there are other folks that the person would suggest you connect with based on your interests to build your network. 

People might not respond to your invitation to connect. It's ok to follow-up after a week or reach out to someone else.

From courses I've taught with mentoring as a key component, a lot of students worry about being a burden or wasting someone's time. I try to remind students that it is important to prepare for informational interviews, and it is also good practice to have them. 

## My approach to mentoring

Often times, people who are further along in their careers have a lot of perspective and experience that they will happily distill into advice. Sometimes, we just need someone to ask us the right questions for us to find our own answers. My commitment is to be as much of a question-asker as I can be – my positionality limits what I can understand about different life experiences, and I trust that students know their context best.

Like teaching, I think of mentoring as an ever-evolving field and practice. It will depend on the person and their needs. It will depend on my capacity. As a starting point, but not a prescription, I believe good mentoring starts with trust building and getting to know what each person's needs are. I also think, while challenging, having an honest conversation about how to give feedback and how to manage conflict upfront can be a part of the trust building. 

As [Trevor Tuma et al. (2021)](https://www.lifescied.org/doi/10.1187/cbe.20-10-0231) puts it, negative mentoring experiences can be "problematic aspects of an otherwise positive or healthy relationship."
